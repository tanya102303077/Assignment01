# Topsis-Tanya-102303077

## Project Description

**For:** Project-1 (UCS654 – Predictive Analytics)  
**Submitted by:** Tanya Mediratta
**Roll Number:** 102303077  

**Topsis-Tanya-102303077** is a Python package designed to solve **Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)** problems using the **Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)** method.

The package ranks multiple alternatives based on their relative distance from the ideal best and ideal worst solutions. It is implemented as a **command-line tool**, making it easy to use for real-world decision-making applications.

---

## Installation

Install the package using `pip`:

```bash
pip install Topsis-Tanya-102303077
```

---

## Usage

Run the package from the command line by providing:

- Input CSV file
- Weights vector
- Impacts vector
- Output file name

```bash
topsis data.csv "1,1,1,2" "+,-,-,+" result.csv
```

If vectors contain spaces, they must be enclosed within double quotes (`" "`).

---

## Input Format

- Input file must be in **CSV format**
- First column contains **alternatives** (e.g., items, models, options)
- Remaining columns contain **numeric criteria values**
- Minimum of **three columns** required
- No categorical values allowed in criteria columns

---

## Example

### Sample Input File (`data.csv`)

```csv
Fund Name,P1,P2,P3,P4
M1,0.67,0.45,6.5,42.6
M2,0.60,0.36,3.6,53.3
M3,0.82,0.67,3.8,63.1
M4,0.60,0.36,3.5,69.2
M5,0.76,0.58,4.8,43.0
```

### Command

```bash
topsis data.csv "1,1,1,2" "+,-,-,+" result.csv
```

---

## Output

The output CSV file contains:

- Original input data
- **TOPSIS Score** for each alternative
- **Rank** based on TOPSIS score  
  (Higher score indicates better rank)

---

## Features

- Command-line based execution
- Supports user-defined weights and impacts
- Input validation and error handling
- Ranks alternatives using TOPSIS method
- Generates results in CSV format

---

## Notes

- Number of weights must match number of criteria
- Number of impacts must match number of criteria
- Impacts must be either `+` or `-`
- Input CSV must contain only numeric values (except first column)
